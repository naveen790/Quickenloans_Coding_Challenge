- Question  
  
Write a program to sort a list of strings. Calculate the time complexity of the program.  
  
- Solution  
  
 - The question states to sort a "list of strings" so I implemented a program to sort an ArrayList of strings 
 - I assumed "HI" is same as "hi","Hi","hI". I convert the strings to lowercase before sorting  
   
 
This program was run using Java 1.8
   
The arraylist takes user input for the size and content of the list. I used "mergesort" to sort the arraylist.  
# The time complexity of the program is O(n log(n)) time.
